# OpenCTI Docker deployment

## Documentation

You can find the detailed documentation about the Docker installation in the [OpenCTI documentation space](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/deployment/installation/#using-docker).

## XTM One

This stack bundles [XTM One](https://filigran.io), Filigran's AI-powered assistant, alongside OpenCTI. The following services are started by default:

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `xtm-one` | XTM One platform (web UI + API, exposed on `XTM_ONE_PORT`) |
| `xtm-one-worker` | XTM One background worker |
| `pgsql-xtm-one` | Dedicated PostgreSQL + `pgvector` instance for XTM One |

XTM One reuses the shared `redis` and `minio` services and connects to OpenCTI internally via `OPENCTI_API_URL`. OpenCTI registers itself with XTM One using `PLATFORM_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` — this shared secret **must be identical** across every platform connected to the same XTM One instance.

All XTM One configuration (admin credentials, dedicated Postgres credentials, S3 bucket, license, log settings) lives in the `XTM ONE` section of [.env.sample](.env.sample). Once the stack is healthy, XTM One is available on `http://localhost:${XTM_ONE_PORT}` (default `8090`).
